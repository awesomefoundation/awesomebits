    And a project was created on each of the last 7 days for a different chapter
    And a project was created on each of the last 7 days for any chapter
    When I am looking at the list of projects
    And I want to see my projects for the past 3 days
    Then I should see my projects for the past 3 days
    And I should not see projects that are not mine
