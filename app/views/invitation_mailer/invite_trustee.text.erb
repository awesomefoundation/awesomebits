Hi <%= @invitation.first_name %> <%= @invitation.last_name %>!

You have been invited to join AwesomeFoundation.org as a trustee of the
<%= @invitation.chapter.name %> chapter! Yay!

<%= new_invitation_acceptance_url(@invitation, :locale => I18n.locale) %>

Once you accept the invitation, you’ll be listed as a trustee on the
chapter’s website. You’ll also be able to read and create personal
shortlists for your chapter’s applications. It’ll be a really good time, we
promise.
