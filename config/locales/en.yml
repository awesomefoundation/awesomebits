        header: Awesome is everywhere!
        body: The Awesome Foundation is an ever-growing worldwide community devoted to forwarding the interest of awesome in the universe. Created in the long hot summer days of 2009 in Boston, the Foundation distributes $1,000 grants, no strings attached, to projects and their creators. At each fully autonomous chapter, the money is pooled together from the coffers of ten or so self-organizing “micro-trustees” and given up front in cash, check, or gold doubloons.

      headline: Anyone Can Start An Awesome Foundation Chapter
      intro: |
        The Awesome Foundation isn't actually a foundation at all — it's a grassroots movement! Our global community is made up of amazing people who have made the decision to make their communities a bit more awesome. They organize to assemble, launch, and run their own chapters.

        We're probably biased, but we think it's a lot of fun. Chapters have made amazing things happen all around the world, from [building a giant hammock](/en/projects/188-the-big-hammock) and [assembling swings in public places](/en/projects/2598-swings), to [helping dogs play poker](/en/projects/50233-dogs-playing-poker-live) and [letting anyone be Indiana Jones for a day](/en/projects/5071-indiana-jones-and-the-alley-of-doom).

        **Sound awesome? Read on to learn how you can start your own chapter!**

      existing_chapters_text: There are Awesome Foundation chapters all around the world so it's possible that there is already a chapter in your area. Check the "Chapters" menu above to see if there is one, and get in touch with them if you see one nearby.
      handbook_header: Download the Handbook
      handbook_text: To help you get started, we collected the wisdom we've gained from giving out thousands of grants since 2009 and put it in our [New Chapter Handbook](http://wiki.awesomestudies.org/images/9/92/Awesome_Foundation_New_Chapter_Handbook.pdf). Download it and give it a read to find out what it takes to start your own chapter. Do that now — we'll wait!
      contact_header: Get in Touch
      contact_text: So you've read the handbook and you're ready to get started. Great! Send an email to join@awesomefoundation.org and tell us who you are and where you're starting your chapter. We'll connect you with the global Awesome Foundation community and will answer any questions you might have about getting your chapter up and running.
      trustees_header: Assemble your trustees
      trustees_text: Trustees are at the heart of each Awesome Foundation chapter. They chip in money each month (usually $100 or the local equivalent) and they decide the winner of each grant. It's your job to find these folks and bring them all together! Once you've assembled most of your team, let us know and we'll add you to our website so you can start accepting grant applications.
      launch_header: Launch
      launch_text: Congratulations! You are now part of the Awesome Foundation movement. Tell everyone about your new chapter and start funding the fantastic, wonderful, and (dare we say) awesome in your community.
