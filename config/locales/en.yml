        body-html: "Have a crazy brilliant idea that needs funding? We award <strong>$1,000 grants every month</strong>. It couldn't be simpler! Your idea is yours alone. We don't want a stake in it. We just want to help you make it happen!"

        header: Awesome is Everywhere!
        body: The Awesome Foundation for the Arts and Sciences is an ever-growing, worldwide network of people devoted to forwarding the interest of awesomeness in the universe. Created in the long hot summer days of 2009 in Boston, the Foundation distributes a series of monthly $1,000 grants to projects and their creators. The money is pooled together from the coffers of ten or so self-organizing “micro-trustees” and given upfront in cash, check, or gold doubloons. The chapters are autonomous and organized by the trustees around geographic areas or topics of interest.

    <p>The Foundation provides these grants with no strings attached and claims no ownership over the projects it supports. It is, in the words of one of our trustees, a micro-genius grant for flashes of micro-brilliance.</p>
    <p>Since its humble beginnings, many <a href=\"http://awesomefoundation.org/chapters/\">Awesome Foundation chapters have sprung up globally</a> to conserve, sustain, and support the worldwide ecosystem of awesomeness. Projects have included efforts in a wide range of areas including technology, arts, social good, and beyond.</p>
