AwesomeBits
===========

Configuration
-------------

### Docker

To start developing this project quickly, feel free to use the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) workflow. This will install a local Postgres database in a Docker container, and the Rails app in another container.   

#### Installing the Docker runtime

##### Linux: Install the Native Docker Engine

If you're developing on a Linux system, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) to install Docker natively on your system. You will also need to install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

##### Mac or Windows: Install Docker Machine

If you're developing from a Mac or Windows machine, you will need to use [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) to run the Docker engine in a Linux VM and proxy commands to it. You can install Docker Machine via the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox). The Docker toolbox will also install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Once you have Docker Machine installed, you'll need to create a new machine for this project. Assuming you have [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed, you'd run the following:

```bash
docker-machine create -d virtualbox awesomebits
eval $(docker-machine env awesomebits)
```

#### Starting the app with Docker Compose

Once you have the Docker engine and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed, you should be able to launch the app with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If successful, your terminal should look something like this:

![Docker Compose Up Success](doc/awesomebits-docker-compose-up.gif)

#### Executing arbitary commands with Docker Compose

You can also run arbitrary commands within the Docker container. For example, to run `rails console`, do the following:

```bash
docker-compose run web rails console
```

### Environment Variables

In order to set environment variables (for example, to enable S3 in your development environment),
create a file called `.env` in the main project directory. This file will look like this:

```shell
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYY
AWS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

Secret Token
------------

When deploying to production, the SECRET_TOKEN environment variable must
be set. This token only needs to be generated once and then stored in
the environment variable, but it must be kept secret. This does not need
to be set in development or test environments.

For a Heroku deployment, something like the following could be used:

```shell
$ heroku config:set SECRET_TOKEN=`rake secret`
```


Countries
---------

Constant COUNTRY_PRIORITY used to define an array of priority countries. This
used in the Chapter Form to create quick access to popular countries; also used
in CountrySorter model for sorting the chapters.

Constant can be found in initializers file. /config/initializers/countries.rb


Localization
------------

Much of the AwesomeBits interface has been localized. Localization files are 
stored in two places, depending on the type of content being localized:

* Discrete srings and localizations are stored in config/locales/ directory
  with a separate file for each language
* Partials with localized content are stored in the app/views/locales/
  directory with the locale in the names of the file (i.e. _about_us.en.md)


Images
------

Images are resized dynamically via the [Magickly gem](http://magickly.afeld.me). 
In order to display images properly, you must have a Magickly installation running
and you must set the MAGICKLY_HOST environment variable to point to that host. 

e.g. If you are running Magickly localy on port 8888, add the following line to your `.env` file:

```shell
MAGICKLY_HOST=http://localhost:8888
```


Blacklist
---------

Very basic blacklisting is implemented using [Rack::Attack](https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack).
To blacklist an IP, simply add the IP address to the BLACKLIST_IPS environment
variable. Multiple IPs should be comma separated:

```shell
BLACKLIST_IPS=10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2
```

Password Protection
-------------------

There are instances where you want to put a password on the entire site (for
example, a staging server which is on the public internet but should not be
accessible to the general public). Set the `SITE_PASSWORD` environment
variable to a password you want people to have to use to access the site.
The user should then enter the `SITE_PASSWORD` text for both the username
and password when prompted.

```shell
SITE_PASSWORD=topsecret
```

HTTPS
-----

The site can be forced to redirect users to https pages by setting the
`FORCE_HTTPS` environment variable. By doing this, all traffic to the `www`
subdomain will be forced to https.

NOTE: We do not currently enforce HSTS in case there is a problem and we
need to turn off https. This might change in the future.

```shell
FORCE_HTTPS=true
```
