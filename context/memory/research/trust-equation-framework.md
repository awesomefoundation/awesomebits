# Trust Equation Framework

## Overview

Signal Score uses Maister's Trust Equation as its scoring backbone:

```
T = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / (1 + Self-Interest)
```

Each dimension maps to observable signals in grant applications.

## Dimension Mapping

### Credibility (numerator)
- Clear budget with specific line items
- Realistic plan with timeline
- Relevant expertise or demonstrated competence
- Named vendors, partners, suppliers

### Reliability (numerator)
- Track record: prior events, projects, grants
- Organizational backing or institutional support
- Evidence of follow-through (photos, links to past work)
- Repeat applicants with history

### Intimacy (numerator)
- Connection to cause/community
- Local specificity: named neighborhoods, streets, aldermen
- Personal anecdotes and authentic voice
- Sub-city precision (ward, zip, not just city name)

### Self-Interest (denominator — higher = worse)
- Money primarily benefits applicant (living expenses, tuition, salary)
- Business startup where applicant is primary beneficiary
- Self-payment > 50% of budget → almost always hidden
- Professional credential emphasis (awards, degrees)

## Validation Results (Chicago Chapter, n=181)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Funded avg score | 0.717 |
| Hidden avg score | 0.277 |
| Funded > 0.7 | 88% |
| Hidden < 0.3 | 65% |
| False negatives (funded < 0.3) | **0** |

## Key Insight

The Trust Equation maps directly to AF's own grantee evaluation criteria from the New Chapter Handbook:
1. Likelihood of short-timespan completion → Reliability + Specificity
2. Perceived ability of applicant → Credibility
3. Ability of grant to make a difference → Budget Alignment
